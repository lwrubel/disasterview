    	<h3>About this project</h3>
        <p>This web application was created by Laura Wrubel, as the product of a three-month research leave from the 
        George Washington University Libraries in the spring of 2015. The primary goal of my research leave was to develop new coding skills and 
        gain experience with a number of web technologies, including APIs from several large digital collections. 
        The <a href="http://www.mith.umd.edu">Maryland Institute for Technology for the Humanities</a>
         (MITH) at the University of Maryland hosted me during my sabbatical and provided mentorship.</p>
        
        <p>In Disaster View, I'm experimenting with ways to explore image collections from the <a href="http://dp.la">Digital
        Public Library of America (DPLA)</a> and the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures">Library of Congress Prints and 
        Photographs Online Catalog</a>. Both sites provide access to a wide range of images across time and geography. 
        I chose to focus on images of catastrophe, specifically natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes 
        and forest fires. </p>
        
        <p>Code for the site is <a href="http://www.github.com/lwrubel/disasterview">posted on Github</a>. The application uses:
        <ul>
          <li>Python scripts for connecting to the APIs and loading content into a database</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB database</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/">Flask</a> with <a href="https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">PyMongo</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/">LeafletJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster">Leaflet.markercluster</a> for maps</li>

        <p>This project and my related time learning code would not have been possible without:</p>
        
        <p>George Washington University Libraries and its support for librarian research leave, and my colleagues who
          covered my responsibilities during my time away. </p>
        
        <p>The <a href="http://www.mith.umd.edu">Maryland Institute for Technology for the Humanities</a>
         (MITH) at the University of Maryland, who kindly hosted me during my three-month research leave. The MITH staff, particularly
         Trevor Mu√±oz, Ed Summers, and Raffaele Viglianti, were generous with their time, advice, and encouragement. I have a great admiration for the 
         thoughtful and inspired work they are accomplishing. </p>
        
        <p>I am also grateful to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Josh Westgard, Ben Wallberg, and the rest of the Code Workshop at University of Maryland Libraries, for 
          allowing me to participate in their weekly code meetings where they share code problems and work on solutions together</li>
          <li>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dc-pyladies/">PyLadies DC</a> group, who offered a free workshop on Flask 
          and other opportunities to learn Python</li>
