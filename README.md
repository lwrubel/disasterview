An experiment in exploring ways to visualize image collections from the <a href="http://dp.la">Digital
Public Library of America (DPLA)</a> and the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures">Library of Congress Prints and 
Photographs Online Catalog</a>. Both sites provide access to a wide range of images across time and geography. 
Retrieves metadata about images of catastrophes--specifically, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes--and provides ways to browse and explore the imagery. Includes a Pinterest-style browse, map, and ability to save selections. 

Uses:
* Python scripts for connecting to the APIs and loading content into a database
